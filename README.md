# wagmi + Vite Project: MetaCert Frontend

Welcome to the wagmi + Vite project! This project is bootstrapped with `create-wagmi` and utilizes the Vite framework. It serves as the frontend for MetaCert, a decentralized application that leverages Worldcoin ID for proof of personhood and a web3 wallet (MetaMask for demo purposes).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Launch the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

The project incorporates an innovative feature where a unique artwork is generated based on the Ethereum address from MetaMask. This is achieved by making use of the nouns API provided by `https://noun-api.com/beta/pfp?name=<address>`.

Users can claim their personalized nouns artwork, and the companion [metaid-issuer-express](https://github.com/peopledrivemecrazy/metaid-issuer-express) facilitates this process. The metaid-issuer-express repository offers the following functionalities:

- `issue/id`: Issues the nouns using a custom 721 contract called MetaID721.
- `issue/cert`: Issues the Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) tokens using a custom 1155 contract called MetaCert.
- Provides APIs for `tokenUri` to retrieve the metadata of the tokens.
- Allows for the addition of new certificates generated by AI tests through the [waterloo-test-server](https://github.com/endymionjkb/waterloo-test-server).

## After Claiming the ID

Once you have successfully claimed your ID, you will possess an NFT that serves as proof of your personhood. This NFT becomes your unique chain identity within the MetaCert application. Rest assured that your privacy remains intact, as no personal information is exposed to the outside world.

Additionally, you can take advantage of the AI-generated tests to claim bounties using the ERC-6551 Token Bound Account.
